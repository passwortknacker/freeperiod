# Codex in FreePeriod. – project addendum to skill `codex-delegation`

Same conventions as JaySay (`Diktier App/aufpasser/codex-projekt.md`) unless stated here.
Fixed rules for Codex live in `AGENTS.md` (created in M0; do not repeat them in prompts).

## Roles
- Claude = supervisor ("Aufpasser"), owner = Marvin. Short answers to Marvin.
- Since round 24 Claude is the main developer (owner prefers raising the Claude plan over running
  out of Codex). Codex only for big rounds it does better; Claude plans, reviews, verifies, commits.
- Project state for a new session: `docs/handover.md`.

## Models
- Coding: `gpt-6.1-sol`, effort `high`; `xhigh` only after asking Marvin.
- Design/judgement/review/images: `gpt-6-astra`.
- Never: `gpt-6-luna`, `gpt-6-sol` (6.0), `ultra`, effort below `high`.

## Paths and commands
- Repo: `C:\Users\kempe\Desktop\Projekte\Period Tracker`. Rounds: `aufpasser/runden/prompt-N.txt`,
  `runde-N.md|.jsonl|.log` (jsonl/log git-ignored).
- Start (fresh, detached), from repo root:
  `Start-Process powershell -ArgumentList '-NoProfile','-ExecutionPolicy','Bypass','-Command',"Set-Location '<repo>'; Get-Content -Raw -Encoding utf8 aufpasser\runden\prompt-N.txt | codex exec -m <model> -c model_reasoning_effort=high --json -C '<repo>' -s workspace-write -c approval_policy=never -o aufpasser\runden\runde-N.md - > aufpasser\runden\runde-N.jsonl 2> aufpasser\runden\runde-N.log" -WindowStyle Hidden`
- Review-only rounds: `-s read-only`.
- Resume: `--add-dir` is NOT inherited. Pass the Gradle cache explicitly:
  `codex exec resume <thread> -m <model> -c model_reasoning_effort=high -c sandbox_mode=workspace-write -c approval_policy=never -c 'sandbox_workspace_write.writable_roots=["C:\\Users\\kempe\\dev-tools\\gradle-home"]' --json -o … -`

| 23 | gpt-6.1-sol/high fresh | (see runde-23.jsonl) | Higher-chance-of-pregnancy days (default on, spec §12) + medical disclaimer, +303 lines. Claude: fixed situation-switch persistence bug, poisoned Gradle build cache (caching off), readability pass, period block, feedback mail, chip grid |
| 24 | – cancelled | – | Design polish done by Claude instead (Codex quota 39 % on day 2; owner: Codex only for what it does better) |
| 25 | gpt-6.1-sol/high fresh | (see runde-25.jsonl) | 1.1 "Customize everything" Stage A+B: own items as tags in `builtin:<field>` marker categories, `EntrySelection`/`EntryAppearance`/`EntryCsv`, Room 3, backup schema 3, CSV diary import (+1,457 lines; 7.3 M input, quota 88 → 90 %). Claude fixed 5 tests the sandbox couldn't run (Robolectric NATIVE graphics), icons only where meaningful, symptom order, one-row item editor; commit c1baa6a |

Automatic backup (local folder, Keystore-sealed password, WorkManager) was built by Claude in parallel on
branch `auto-backup` and merged after round 25.

**Claude-only work since round 24 (no Codex):** 6–8 day higher-chance window around the middle of the
prediction (Wilcox 1995/2000, Bull 2019); Today calendar scrolls freely, snaps to week rows; Today fits one
screen (`OneScreenColumn`: calendar takes the rest, legend always visible; large fonts keep 3 weeks and scroll);
pregnancy-chance hint moved from the card into the legend; icon set 24 → 102 picker icons in 10 groups
(`FpIcons.groups`, `ic_item_*`, spoken names `icon_*`), icon choice also for categories, "sad" is now a face.
Icon source paths: Claude's generator script (scratchpad) – the XML drawables are the source of truth.
Owner decision 2026-10-09: calendar marks period days by chance (normal start spread × period length):
≥ 60 % "likely", ≥ 30 % "possible"; the period after next with spread × √2. CSV export is one file (one row
per day, `period_day`), re-importable. Settings: measured cycle length, archived categories restorable,
lock intro + 10/15 min.
Owner feedback 2026-10-09 (later): the period after next counts as "possible" from 20 % (short periods with
spread × √2 never reach 30 %); always exactly two periods are predicted. Today uses the same accent as every
screen (light fills too pale on the Today surfaces get a thin border edge instead of a darker shade). Ink is the
dark, non-pastel alternative (light #2F3440 with light text, dark graphite #9A9EA6); onAccent follows fill
luminance. Appearance preview: more space between sample days and below the badge.
Release 2026-10-09: plural forms EN/DE, 19 unused strings removed; v1.0.0 versionCode 2 (commit 83fa0dc)
submitted to Play production review. GitHub account renamed to `pavoras` (site pavoras.github.io/freeperiod).

**Decision 2026-10-08:** both threads are too long (resumes cost 2–4 % weekly quota each). Next rounds start
fresh with a short handover. Codex quota must last until the reset (Wed 14.10. 10:15); Claude takes small
and medium work, Codex only big rounds. `~/.codex/config.toml`: `model_auto_compact_token_limit = 150000`.

Device: Marvin's S22 Ultra via Wi-Fi debugging (`adb connect 192.168.178.21:<port>`; port changes, pairing already done for this laptop).

Start rounds with `aufpasser\runden\start.ps1 -N <n> [-Model m] [-Resume id] [-ReadOnly]`.
HTML mockups → PNG: headless Edge (`msedge --headless=new --screenshot=… --window-size=…`) from a temp dir without spaces.

## Toolchain notes
- Gradle 8.11.1 at `C:\Users\kempe\dev-tools\gradle-8.11.1` (copied from JaySay), JDK 17, SDK 36, shared
  `dev-tools\gradle-home` cache (filled online by Claude via `tools\check.ps1 -Voll -Online`).
- WorkManager's ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE/FOREGROUND_SERVICE + SystemForegroundService removed in manifest.
